CHANGELOG

0.1.2 / 2014-05-29
* Add LineInterpolatePoint -- returns a point interpolated along a line, ala
similar functionality in PostGIS, useful for geocoding, for example.

* Allow GEOS version 3.3.9 (in addition to 3.3.8) -- support for GEOS version >=
3.4.x may be pending in 0.1.3.

* Add ProjectNormalized -- linear referencing function (thanks, bdon@bdon.org!)

* Fix race condition -- library should be thread-safe with respect to underlying
GEOS C library.

* Fix bug with join and cap style constants.

0.1.1 / 2013-06-14
* Add BufferWithOpts -- provides user more control over buffering options,
including # of quadrant segments, end cap & join styles, mitre limit, and
single-sidedness.

* Add OffsetCurve -- computes a new LineString offset from the input LineString
by a given distance.

* Add WKB encoding/decoding -- geometries can now be constructed from Well-Known
Binary (both raw bytes and hex-encoded), and conversely be output as WKB.

0.1.0 / 2013-06-12
* Initial release
